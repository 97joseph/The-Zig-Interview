Backend (Server-side)

1) Created a Popular movies controller that sends a get request to TMDB to return the popular movies
2) Created a Search movies controller that sends a get request to TMDB to return the searched movies 
3) Enabled CORS to allow resource sharing and allowing the frontend to get data from the backend
4) Added SwaggerUI for the documenting of the api
5) Used HttpclientFactory to create a new client and send requests to the api 
6) Implemented Dependancy Injection in the popular and Search movies controller

Frontend (Client-side)

1) Managed to load movies through the serverside endpoint (https://localhost:44325/api/popular)
2) Added the Search Endpoint to allow the client side to search movies via the search term passed to the Serverside endpoint (https://localhost:44325/api/search)
3) Added React-Router
4) Used CSS for Styling
